The & symbol lets variables inside a function be linked with variables inside another function. Hence this creates side effects becuase you can modify variables outside the local scope. This is something which is very interesting and at first I was very confused as to how this could even work. I am guessing that there are many advantages to this otherwise we would not be learning it. The advantages of this side effect include that flexibility in functions. Usually I am always worried if a function has local variables in order to access them. However now I can use different variables which are being passed by reference. I can simply pass references without copying the entire data. The disadvantage of this includes that it can make the code harder to read. If the code has multiple pointers and references it might be harder to mantain the code. Moreover, it can cause side effects as we are modifying variables that belong to a different scope. This may cause you to modify variables without knowing.
