Key Learnings so far:
   1. The first thing I learned was that this terminal allows me to essentially communicate with my computer in a simple way
   2. I learned what a directory (folder) is and how to create one using the linux commands, and also how to change directory to go into a folder
   3. I also learned that vim is a very useful text editor which allows me to create files and create scripts, and I learned how to enter the different modes such as insert and command mode.

Excited: I am excited to see the other functionality of linux, vim and its commands in order to actually create a project all using the command line and maybe even using things like git in the future to maintain code.

Worries: To be honest I do not have any worries for this course, so far it is going very smoothly and I would say it is the most interesting course because of how much hands on learning there is. I also enjoy this course because I feel like this is very good base knowledge for me to start my development journey.
