a)The script "di" essentailly has one line which is $1. $1 is a special variable which is able to access the paramaters that the user provides when using the command line. For examples in the command line if I run the executable ./di followed by a paramater such as ls -l, this argument will be sent to the script from the command line. Then the script will simply execute it. In this case the script will execute the command, which sends the output to stout which is the command line.
